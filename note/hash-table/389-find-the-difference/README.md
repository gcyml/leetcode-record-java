## 思路

``` java
class Solution {
    public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
        int[] array = new int[26];
        for(char c: s.toCharArray()) {
            array[c-'a']++;
        }
        for(char c: t.toCharArray()) {
            array[c-'a']--;
        }
        int res = 0;
        while(array[res] == 0){
            res++;
        }
        return (char)(res+'a');
    }
}
